TASK 1: How websites work
- When you visit a website, your browser (like Safari or Google Chrome) makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you're visiting. 
- It will respond with data that your browser uses to show you the page; a web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests.
- There are two major components that make up a website:
        i. Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
        ii. Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.
