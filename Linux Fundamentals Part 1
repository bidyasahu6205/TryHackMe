a. If we wanted to output the text "TryHackMe", what would our command be?
sol. echo TryHackMe
tryhackme@linux1:~$ echo TryHackMe
TryHackMe

b. What is the username of who you're logged in as on your deployed Linux machine?
sol. tryhackme
to get the answer the command shoud be  " whoami "
tryhackme@linux1:~$ whoami

TASK 5
This task introduces some basic commands to interact with the filesystem 
Command            	Full Name                       syntax

pwd	                print working directory          pwd

a. On the Linux machine that you deploy, how many folders are there?
sol. 4
command ls

access.log  folder2  folder4
folder1     folder3

b. Which directory contains a file? 
sol. folder4
command ls directory_name_or_path
after using the command for all the directory we found the answer ie folder4
eg ls folder4
tryhackme@linux1:~$ ^C
tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls folder1
tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls folder2
tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls folder3
tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls folder4
note.txt

c. What is the contents of this file?
sol. Hello World
tryhackme@linux1:~$ cat folder4/note.txt 
Hello World!

d. Use the cd command to navigate to this file and find out the new current working directory. What is the path?
sol. /home/tryhackme/folder4
tryhackme@linux1:~$ cd /home/tryhackme/fol
der4
tryhackme@linux1:~/folder4$ 

TASK 6
this task taught find command. you can learn more about it using the man or help command.
Command                                    	Description                                    Syntax

grep                              search for specific patterns within files or input.      grep specific_pattern
wc                                counts the number of words in a file                     wc file_name

a. Use grep on "access.log" to find the flag that has a prefix of "THM". What is the flag?
sol. THM{ACCESS}
tryhackme@linux1:~$ grep "THM" access.log
THM{ACCESS}
tryhackme@linux1:~$

TASK 7
It introduce us to the shell operators
Symbol / Operator          	Description
&	                          This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&&	                        This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
>	                          This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
>>	                        This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).

a. If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use?
sol. &

b. If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be?
sol. echo password123 > passwords

c.  Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be
sol. echo tryhackme >> passwords
