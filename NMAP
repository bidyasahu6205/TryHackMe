TASK 6 
SYN SCANS (-sS)
- SYN scans are used to scan the TCP port-range of a target or targets.
- sometimes referred to as "Half-open" scans, or "Stealth" scans.
- SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request). 
- Advantages for us as hackers:
  > It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they are looking out for a full three way handshake. This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; it is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as "stealth" scans.
  > SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again, this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy.
  > Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port, SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan.
- Disadvantages
  > Require sudo permissions[1] in order to work correctly in Linux because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default. 
  > Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a production environment for the test.
- SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap if run with sudo permissions.
- If a port is closed then the server responds with a RST TCP packet. 
- . If the port is filtered by a firewall then the TCP SYN packet is either dropped, or spoofed with a TCP reset.

a. There are two other names for a SYN scan, what are they?
sol. Half-Open, Stealth

b. Can Nmap use a SYN scan without Sudo permissions (Y/N)?
sol. N
