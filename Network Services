TASK 2
SMB
- Server Message block Protocol
- Client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers,serial ports and other resources on a network.
- The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. 
- 

TASK 4
Types of SMB Exploit
- While there are vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-7494 that can allow remote code execution by exploiting SMB, you're more likely to encounter a situation where the best way into a system is due to misconfigurations in the system.
- we're going to be exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.
- Method Breakdown
So, from our enumeration stage, we know:
    - The SMB share location
    - The name of an interesting SMB share
SMBClient
Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers.
We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite.
We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:
smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]
Followed by the tags:
-U [name] : to specify the user
-p [port] : to specify the port

a. What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?
sol. smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445
