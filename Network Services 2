TASK 2: Understanding NFS
- NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network.
- By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files.
- It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. 
- The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file
- First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device.
- The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.
- The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.
- If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. 
  -> This call takes parameters such as:
    i.  The file handle
    ii. The name of the file to be accessed
    iii. The user's, user ID
    iv. The user's group ID
  -> These are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions, I.E read and write of files.
- Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.
- A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.
