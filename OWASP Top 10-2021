TASK 2: Accessing Machines
a. Connect to our network
- Download the compartible configuration file from: https://tryhackme.com/r/access
- then use the command: openvpn file_name

TASK 3: Broken Access Control
- Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors. For example, only the site's admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users.
- If a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the access controls are broken.
- A regular visitor being able to access protected pages can lead to the following:
    -> Being able to view sensitive information from other users
    -> Accessing unauthorized functionality
- Simply put, broken access control allows attackers to bypass authorisation, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.
- For example, a vulnerability was found in 2019, where an attacker could get any single frame from a Youtube video marked as private. The researcher who found the vulnerability showed that he could ask for several frames and somewhat reconstruct the video.
- Since the expectation from a user when marking a video as private would be that nobody had access to it, this was indeed accepted as a broken access control vulnerability.

TASK 4: Broken Access Control (IDOR Challenge)
- Insecure Direct Object Reference: refers to an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to see. 
- This occurs when the programmer exposes a Direct Object Reference, which is just an identifier that refers to specific objects within the server. 
- By object, we could mean a file, a user, a bank account in a banking application, or anything really.
- For example
    ->let's say we're logging into our bank account, and after correctly authenticating ourselves, we get taken to a URL like this https://bank.thm/account?id=111111.
    -> On that page, we can see all our important bank details, and a user would do whatever they need to do and move along their way, thinking nothing is wrong.
    -> There is, however, a potentially huge problem here, anyone may be able to change the id parameter to something else like 222222, and if the site is incorrectly configured, then he would have access to someone else's bank information.
- The application exposes a direct object reference through the id parameter in the URL, which points to specific accounts.
- Since the application isn't checking if the logged-in user owns the referenced account, an attacker can get sensitive information from other users because of the IDOR vulnerability.
- Notice that direct object references aren't the problem, but rather that the application doesn't validate if the logged-in user should have access to the requested account.

a. Deploy the machine and go to http://10.10.224.142 - Login with the username noot and the password test1234.
open the url and login change the id parameter till you find the flag keep note what is writen in the page for each of the id till you find the flag.

TASK 5: Cryptographic Failures
- A cryptographic failure refers to any vulnerability arising from the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information. 
- Web applications require cryptography to provide confidentiality for their users at many levels.

- Take, for example, a secure email application:
- When you are accessing your email account using your browser, you want to be sure that the communications between you and the server are encrypted. That way, any eavesdropper trying to capture your network packets won't be able to recover the content of your email addresses.
- When we encrypt the network traffic between the client and server, we usually refer to this as encrypting data in transit.
- Since your emails are stored in some server managed by your provider, it is also desirable that the email provider can't read their client's emails. To this end, your emails might also be encrypted when stored on the servers. This is referred to as encrypting data at rest.

- Cryptographic failures often end up in web apps accidentally divulging sensitive data. This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates of birth, financial information), but it could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords.
- At more complex levels, taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as "Man in The Middle Attacks", whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device they control.
- Then, they would take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to access the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place). Of course, many examples are much simpler, and vulnerabilities can be found in web apps that can be exploited without advanced networking knowledge.
- Indeed, in some cases, the sensitive data can be found directly on the web server itself.

TASK 6: Cryptographic Failures (Supporting Material 1)
- The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format easily accessible from many locations is in a database.
- This is perfect for something like a web application, as many users may interact with the website at any time. Database engines usually follow the Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax.
- In a production environment, it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. 
- These are referred to as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer. This is much easier than setting up an entire database server and could potentially be seen in smaller web applications. 
- flat-file databases are stored as a file on the disk of a computer. Usually, this would not be a problem for a web app, but what happens if the database is stored underneath the root directory of the website (i.e. one of the files accessible to the user connecting to the website)
-  Well, we can download and query it on our own machine, with full access to everything in the database. Sensitive Data Exposure, indeed!

- The most common (and simplest) format of a flat-file database is an SQLite database. These can be interacted with in most programming languages and have a dedicated client for querying them on the command line.
- This client is called sqlite3 and is installed on many Linux distributions by default.
    -> To access it, we use sqlite3 <database-name>
    -> From here, we can see the tables in the database by using the .tables command:
    -> PRAGMA table_info(table_name); to see the table information. 
    -> SELECT * FROM table-name;  to dump the information from the table

TASK 7:Cryptographic Failures (Supporting Material 2)
- We saw how to query an SQLite database for sensitive data in the previous task. We found a collection of password hashes, one for each user. In this task, we will briefly cover how to crack these.
- Crackstation: This website is extremely good at cracking weak password hashes. 
- For more complicated hashes, we would need more sophisticated tools; however, all of the crackable password hashes used in today's challenge are weak MD5 hashes, which Crackstation should handle very nicely.
- Let's try pasting the password hash for Joy Paulson, which we found in the previous task (5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99). We solve the Captcha, then click the "Crack Hashes" button:
- We see that the hash was successfully broken, and the user's password was "password". How secure!
- It's worth noting that Crackstation works using a massive wordlist. If the password is not in the wordlist, then Crackstation will not be able to break the hash.
- The challenge is guided, so if Crackstation fails to break a hash in today's box, you can assume that the hash has been specifically designed not to be crackable.

TASK 9: Injection
- Injection

Injection flaws are very common in applications today. These flaws occur because the application interprets user-controlled input as commands or parameters. Injection attacks depend on what technologies are used and how these technologies interpret the input. Some common examples include:

SQL Injection: This occurs when user-controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. This could potentially allow the attacker to access, modify and delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries. This would mean an attacker could steal sensitive information such as personal details and credentials.
Command Injection: This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on application servers, potentially allowing them to access users' systems.
The main defence for preventing injection attacks is ensuring that user-controlled input is not interpreted as queries or commands. There are different ways of doing this:

Using an allow list: when input is sent to the server, this input is compared to a list of safe inputs or characters. If the input is marked as safe, then it is processed. Otherwise, it is rejected, and the application throws an error.
Stripping input: If the input contains dangerous characters, these are removed before processing.
Dangerous characters or input is classified as any input that can change how the underlying data is processed. Instead of manually constructing allow lists or stripping input, various libraries exist that can perform these actions for you.
